This is a simple screen paint program. It creates a transparent overlay over the screen that you can draw on. This program is designed for Windows and not tested on other OSes.

## Installation

This program does not need additional modules, as it only uses `tkinter`.

## How to Use

Select a paint tool on the right panel and drag the mouse cursor on the canvas to use it. Note that the "line" tool will snap to vertical/horizontal if the keyboard 'shift' key is held down while dragging the mouse.

Select the 「填充」(fill) checkbox to make the paint tools create filled shapes. Drag the 「筆寬」(pen thickness) slider to change the thickness of all tools. Click the 「選擇顏色」(choose color) button to change the color that all tools use.

Click the 「最小化」(minimize) button if you want to temporarily hide this program in order to interact with other programs. If you use this option, the canvas content will be saved. Click the program icon in the taskbar to un-minimize.

Click the 「關閉」(close) button to discard the contents of the canvas and return to the title screen of the program.
